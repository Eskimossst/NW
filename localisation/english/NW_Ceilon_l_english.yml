 #Description#
 LKA_Elections_desc:0 "Elections to the state council will determine the policy of our state for years forward."
 LKA_Lanka_desc:0 "The left movement, having gained the support of the people, has every chance of strengthening itself with the subsequent peaceful seizure of power. Expanding leftists will also increase pressure on Britain and its colonial government."
 LKA_Kolombo_desc:0 "Supporting youth leagues is the key to our success. With the support of a new youth movement for a healthy nation, we can achieve much greater success."
 LKA_Suria_Mal_desc:0 "In addition to the workers, our popularity is also supported by volunteer movements such as "Suriya-Mal", which saved thousands of residents during the malaria epidemic. Thanks to them, not only a way to deal with this scourge was developed, but also ways to prevent it in the future."
 LKA_Day_Suria_Mal_desc:0 "«Poppy Day» is a charity event designed to support British veterans. All funds from the sale of poppies on this day are transferred to them. In response, we will create our own holiday with the sale of suria flowers to support our veterans."
 LKA_Marmit_desc:0 "In many regions, our people are malnourished, which weakens their immunity, and sometimes even leads to death. During the malaria epidemic, the bain-marie given to volunteers has shown its usefulness as a niche and nutritious food. Why not mass-produce it for the lower strata of the population?"
 LKA_Molary_desc:0 "The malaria epidemic, which lasted from 1934 to 1935, showed how unprepared our country was for such disasters. It is necessary to vaccinate the entire population in order to protect our people and reduce the number of malaria victims."
 LKA_Work_Press_desc:0 "Rare magazines are far from what is required to support our views. Weekly newspapers handed out to workers, the poor, and even to the planters themselves are what will help spread our goals to the entire population."
 LKA_Fight_desc:0 "Long gone are the days when several people could be in power, and their disagreements did not harm the common cause. It is necessary to decide on who will become the head of the party, and will take the place of the general secretary."
 LKA_My_Radio_desc:0 "Radio «Ceylon» is the most important source of information for the people of our country. By promoting our workers, bribing others and agitating others, we will be able to significantly expand the methods of our agitation against the fight against the imperialist noose!"
 LKA_Non_Alcohol_desc:0 "The alcohol ban law will make our nation healthier and give many more future soldiers who can serve in our conditions."
 LKA_ComParty_desc:0 "Marxism is an antiquated movement. It is necessary to follow in step with progress, which means in step with the USSR, which has gone far ahead of us in understanding Marx's theories."
 LKA_expansion_nepal_desc:0 "To strengthen a newly formed union, it is necessary to look for allies among culturally close countries. Nepal is one of those countries."
 LKA_Kommintern_desc:0 "After Britain retreated, we are forced to look for a reliable ally who will not only be close to us in spirit, but also protect us from possible ill-wishers."
 LKA_Tamil_desc:0 "By lowering the requirements for Tamils and accepting their nation on equal terms with the Sinegals, we will extinguish the long-term conflict of these two peoples. The influx of immigrants from former territories that once belonged to the Tamil empire will also increase."
 LKA_Tamil_India_desc:0 "After we proved our attitude towards Tamils and Nabrahmans, their nationalists began to fully support us, joining the ranks of our army!"
 LKA_TroParty_desc:0 "After much controversy within the party, a group adhering to Trotsky's teachings won."
 LKA_4International_desc:0 "We should find supporters of the revolution to continue our cause. For this, the best solution would be to establish a local section of the 4th international."
 LKA_Heart_desc:0 "To protect our revolution, it is necessary to create special committees to watch over supporters of other ideas."
 LKA_VMFRise_desc:0 "Leftist views have always been popular in the Indian Navy. Having arranged several people there, we will be able to throw a spark into this fire, so that it blazes with great force!"
 LKA_ProfCreate_desc:0 "Expansion of trade unions will allow ordinary people to exchange experiences with each other, create a working atmosphere and lead to new heights."
 LKA_Religion_piece_desc:0 "Despite Buddhism, the inhabitants of the Ceylon Islands practice several types of religion, none of which represent the driving force. It is easier for us to come to terms with them and enlist the support of their followers than to follow the precepts of Marx in this and turn the whole island against us."
 LKA_India_border_desc:0 "To free our brothers from under the heel of British rule, we need to enlist the support of the USSR. Perhaps they will be able to find a way to help us in the good cause of the revolution?"
 LKA_SSSR_General_desc:0 "Soviet advisors will significantly increase the skill level of our commanders in attack."
 LKA_Add_Tamil_India_desc:0 "People from Nebrakhmanian castes fully accepted us and began to advocate the liberation of their lands from India, under our flag - a flag free from British influence!"
 LKA_Help_Revolution_desc:0 "Now that we have made notable progress at home, we can help our brothers in India. We will send the best agitators there, capable of sowing seeds of doubt in the land of the Indian people, as well as using force."
 LKA_india_univer_desc:0 "After the integration of Tamilian lands, it is necessary to integrate the achievements of their schools and institutions, at the same time expanding them to improve the level of education in these regions."
 LKA_vs_islam_1_desc:0 "Militant Islamists pose a threat to India and us. Hit first to eliminate the threat."
 LKA_vs_islam_2_desc:0 "Shiism is a particularly dangerous trend of Islamism, which can threaten our new views. By eliminating them, we will solve the most pressing threats from the Islamists."
 LKA_vs_buddism_1_desc:0 "Buddhists from small countries are completely mired in their ignorance and dare to look askance at the teachings of Buddhism in our country. It is necessary to get rid of these fanatics and their outdated dogmas, giving these peoples a renewed teaching."
 LKA_vs_buddism_2_desc:0 "Tibet is not far behind in its reproaches from its younger brothers. To stop the penetration of Buddhist dissent into our country, we must eliminate its source."
 LKA_RefSelhoz_desc:0 "With the acquisition of relative freedom from Britain, we need new laws in agriculture that will not take into account the presence of white planters who only suck our blood, but will create new farms."
 LKA_RefOrder_desc:0 "After freeing ourselves from British influence, we need to reform our banking system, starting with the creation of the country's central bank, opening branches of foreign banks and reforming the monetary system."
 LKA_RefEkonomic_desc:0 "After the end of the infusion of funds to Britain, our economy needs changes that will help not only maintain the current level, but also significantly increase it."
 LKA_My_Road_JD_desc:0 "Despite many years of ownership of our territories, the British never completed the railways that would cover the entire island. It's time to fix it ourselves, showing that we ourselves can cope with our problems."
 LKA_CNK_desc:0 "Because of the colonial government apparatus, Congress did not have any meaningful influence. In connection with successful negotiations with the Trotskyists, during which we managed to reach a compromise, we can adopt important bills for us."
 LKA_Memorandum_desc:0 "A few years ago, a congressional ministerial memorandum increasing their power was rejected due to strikes. Now we can try again to take it."
 LKA_Religion_Moves_desc:0 "For many years now, three religions have coexisted in our country, and each of them is supported by its own cell of peoples and society of our country. With the growing popularity of Christianity, the situation began to aggravate, and supporters of three other religions formed, albeit fragmented, but a single movement that must be reckoned with."
 LKA_Induism_desc:0 "Hinduism is professed by the most militant Tamil people, who actively oppose British rule. By strengthening ties with them, we will receive meaningful support from the people."
 LKA_Buddism_desc:0 "Buddhism is supported by the largest people of our state - the Senegalese. By strengthening ties with them, we will receive meaningful support from the people."
 LKA_Islam_desc:0 "Islam is supported by the smallest part of the population consisting of the Moors. But the example of India and the Pakistani provinces suggests that we should not forget about the representatives of this religion. By strengthening our ties with them, we will get that part of the support that no one else had before."
 LKA_2Languege_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the largest peoples in our country are Senegal and Tamils, the official language is English, imposed by our invaders. It is necessary to pass a bill, the results of which will be the establishment of two official languages at once: Senegalese and Tamil."
 LKA_Buddism_Moves_desc:0 "Thanks to the support of Minister Jayatilaka, it was possible to establish close ties with the Buddhists, who make up the majority of our country, as well as with their youth."
 LKA_Marksism_Place_desc:0 "By focusing on the religious majority, we will have to make concessions with the workers' parties. Of course, this will add popularity to them, but it will eliminate the possibility of their protests."
 LKA_School_desc:0 "With the support of the association, they asked for a reciprocal favor - to introduce Dhamma schooling throughout the country. Of course, they are ready to donate a decent amount of money for this, which will open many schools around the country."
 LKA_Tamil_Place_desc:0 "By focusing on the religious majority, we will have to make concessions with radical Tamil representatives. Of course, this will add popularity to them, but it will exclude the possibility of their protests against us."
 LKA_Buddism_For_All_desc:0 "It's time to leave religious fragmentation behind and establish one official religion for our country!"
 LKA_RefSudeb_desc:0 "Judicial reform requires significant changes. The British ignored this problem for a long time, but through the efforts of Minister Jayatilak's bloc, it turned out to develop a reform that could correct the situation."
 LKA_Ultimatum_desc:0 "After the conflict with the Trotskyists and the subsequent failures of the policy of Governor Stubbs, we can take advantage of his inept policy and create a precedent by pushing the British governor out of power, transferring his powers to the National Congress."
 LKA_Legs_desc:0 "Britain has been strangling our country for years. It's time to fix that and get off your knees, severing these vicious ties with the British Crown!"
 LKA_You_Pass_desc:0 "We will gain complete independence on our own, without the participation of third parties. Having carried out our own reforms, and stabilizing the situation in the country, we will be able to get the support of the people and completely abandon British participation in our life."
 LKA_Our_Ekonomik_desc:0 "Our economy is no longer dependent on third-party investments and solutions. We ourselves will decide where to send the budget, and promptly manage our funds."
 LKA_New_Parlament_desc:0 "After getting rid of the British colonial apparatus, we need to create a replacement for it that can work much better."
 LKA_our_marketplace_desc:0 "After gaining independence, we need to increase our trade influence and get resources in other countries that are not available on our lands."
 LKA_Radio_Ceilon_desc:0 "The main radio of our country will help us to preserve the newly acquired values."
 LKA_Fuck_You_GB_desc:0 "Britain has ruled us for too long, we need to get rid of its people, culture, and heritage!"
 LKA_India_Free_desc:0 "We were one of the first colonies in our region to break free from British imperialist rule. By setting an example, we can give advice to other subjects of the Commonwealth."
 LKA_Ost_India_Free_desc:0 "We were one of the first colonies in our region to break free from British imperialist rule. By setting an example, we can give advice to other subjects of the Commonwealth."

 LKA_Malasia_Free_desc:0 "We were one of the first colonies in our region to break free from British imperialist rule. By setting an example, we can give advice to other subjects of the Commonwealth."
 LKA_Alliance_Free_Country_desc:0 "Our labors have been crowned with success, and in light of the wars that have engulfed the world, we must take advantage of them by creating a new alliance of independent states."
 LKA_Japan_desc:0 "The negotiations with Japan were successful. They are ready to provide us with guarantees in the event of our declaration of independence. The diplomat also hinted that it is best to do this with the other island colonies of Britain, but their number is completely up to us."
 LKA_gun_parlament_desc:0 "The mutiny was a success, but each of us knows that Britain won't just leave it. To strengthen the country's military potential, the best solution would be an interim military government cooperating with Japan."
 LKA_Ali_JP_desc:0 "To start successful cooperation, you must conclude an alliance."
 LKA_Go_Away_GB_desc:0 "To finally get rid of the influence of the British on their state, it is necessary to get rid of even ordinary residents who are unable to accept the new realities."
 LKA_My_Arhipelags_desc:0 "The islands that revolted with us must be nationalized so that they finally become part of our country."
 LKA_Japan_General_desc:0 "By reorganizing the headquarters on the Japanese model, we will be much better able to plan operations and supply our troops."
 LKA_Japan_Investors_desc:0 "Japanese corporations saw us as a profitable place to invest because we have scarce resources, people and a weak economy that they can develop."
 LKA_Tamil_Nac_desc:0 "By granting citizenship to Tamils, we can call the most militant of them into service."
 LKA_new_verfes_desc:0 "To hold the islands and expand, we need more ships, and to build new ships, we need to increase the number of dockyards."
 LKA_Sea_Recruits_desc:0 "Island dominance requires a properly trained army. The new island training program will help us with this, improving both the operation of the convoys and the training of naval marines."
 LKA_buildshops_JPN_desc:0 "Japan is far ahead of us in everything, including legal proceedings. By adopting their experience in shipbuilding, we can simplify and speed up the work of our dockyards."
 LKA_Japan_Guns_desc:0 "Japan is far ahead of us in everything, including weapons. By adopting their experience in creating rifles, we can simplify and speed up our production."
 LKA_Nashional_Army_desc:0 "By creating a nationalist army, we will increase the patriotism of our people, who are much more willing to go to serve."
 LKA_South_Tamil_desc:0 "Having granted citizenship to the Tamils, and showing our attitude towards their people, we can ask for their land for ourselves, without the risk of getting separatist territories. Of course this will only happen if India agrees."
 LKA_Chain_for_Ost_India_desc:0 "After gaining the islands, a smart decision would be to gain a foothold in Oceania. It is best to organize a full-fledged base there, creating a government loyal to us in one of those countries, as it was before."
 LKA_Island_Impery_desc:0 "Having achieved all the success, we can announce the restoration of the Chola Empire, which occupied the same borders and has an influence comparable to ours."
 LKA_Knee_desc:0 "Despite the opportunity presented itself to move away from the policy of the crown, the national congress is well aware that this process will not be painless for the country, therefore it was decided to remain in the status of the dominion of Britain, asking them for all possible support in the structure of the state."
 LKA_New_Komission_desc:0 "To consolidate the status of dominion, our state will need many changes with which England agreed to help us. The Salisbury Commission, which arrived from there, is called to eliminate all the shortcomings."
 LKA_Order_Change_desc:0 "With the change in legislation, the colonial apparatus will no longer be needed. The transition period will make it much easier for us to change laws and establish the ministers we need."
 LKA_2Parlament_desc:0 "The bicameral parliamentary system will allow taking into account not only the opinion of the top authorities, but also ordinary residents. With such a system, our government will have stronger support from the people."
 LKA_Stop_Descrim_desc:0 "Discrimination against minorities, whether religious, ethnic or gender, has been the norm since the beginning of colonial rule. It's time to fix it by removing your favorite signs of inequality, like rights, or payments for a Poppy day."
 LKA_India_Place_desc:0 "For many years now, because of the policy of Britain, it is very difficult for Indians to obtain citizenship in our country, and even having received it, they face infringement of rights. By giving them full citizen rights and seats in parliament, our government will receive more support."
 LKA_GB_Investors_desc:0 "By sacrificing our autonomy and freedoms, we can ask Britain for new contributions to our development."
 LKA_GB_Societe_desc:0 "Thanks to our close ties with the commonwealth, we are able to train our people in foreign universities.

 LKA_Avstralian_prom_desc:0 "Australian industrial companies have a long history of speed. By inviting their specialists, we can significantly increase the efficiency of our production."

 LKA_GB_colonial_army_desc:0 "Britain has formed additional divisions to defend our island."
 LKA_Patriotizm_desc:0 "To reliably protect our territories, we need not only weapons and people, we need a desire to fight and defend our lands. Skillful propaganda in society and a call for protection from invaders will instill the necessary spirit in our citizens."
 LKA_minimum_colony_app_desc:0 "On the eve of war, a huge colonial apparatus will only worsen the situation. It is necessary to send a request to London asking for its reduction."

 LKA_race_conflict_desc:0 "It is not the first year that conflicts have arisen between the Senegalese and Tamil peoples for many reasons. The new governor should, if not eliminate, then at least significantly extinguish them to advance his new policy."
 LKA_Bank_opened_desc:0 "By opening an official state bank, we can improve the economic situation of the country."
 LKA_Mac_for_all_desc:0 "Poppy Day is one of the reasons for the discord between the British government and the indigenous peoples of Ceylon. It is worth dividing the funds among the veterans of our peoples to eliminate these differences!"
 LKA_piece_with_Left_desc:0 "The crisis situation arose due to the conflict of the former governor with the left-wing parties. The new manager does not intend to make the same mistake, deciding to make peace with the left-wing parties of the country as one of the first actions."
 LKA_Anglo_Ceilon_desc:0 "Joint ventures are a new step in the relationship between Ceylon and Britain. With the growth of these campaigns, our industry will make a significant leap forward."
