#Примечание: Названия Sultanate of Qu'aiti и Sultanate of Kathiri некорректны.
#Султанат Касири и Султанат Куайти стоит переводить либо как просто Qu'aiti и Kathiri, либо Qu'aiti Sultanate of Shihr and Mukalla и Kathiri State of Seiyun. 
#В теории можно переводить их как Qu'aiti Sultanate, но тут я не уверен. 
#Нужно также сменить короткие названия султанатов в локализации

    NWhadhramaut.1.t:0 "War in Hadramaut"
    NWhadhramaut.1.desc:0 "The confrontation between the sultanates of Kathiri and Quayti began long before the latter became our protectorate. Although Kathiri has suffered more than one defeat and loss of access to the sea during the decades of war, the local sultan still only formally recognizes the British protectorate and dreams of uniting all three major sultanates of Hadhramaut under his rule.\n\nWe can intervene and send our own troops to the region, but a Kathiri defeat would mean a strengthening of the Qu'aiti, which, despite its size, is the most advanced state of Arabia. The situation is complicated by the weakness of local administrations. Many settlements consider themselves independent and even the sultans themselves do not know the exact borders of their states. We should probably resort to diplomatic means to reconcile the tribes in Hadhramaut."
    NWhadhramaut.1.a:0 "Diplomacy, backed by aerial bombardment, will ensure peace in the region."
    NWhadhramaut.1.b:0 "We should send our own troops to Hadhramaut"
    NWhadhramaut_1_a_tt:0 "§RIf Kathiri or Qu'aiti do not win the war, in about a year it is more than likely that a peace will be concluded, which will subsequently allow us to impose consultative treaties on the states of the region, effectively depriving the sultanates of what remains of autonomy.§!"
    
    NWhadhramaut.2.t:0 "Transfer of Seiyun"
    NWhadhramaut.2.desc:0 "After we have assisted the Quaithids in subduing the Kathiri Sultanate, we must transfer formal control of Seiyun and the surrounding area to Mukalla. However, given the extreme fragmentation of the region and the weakness of the local administration, it is unlikely that the Qu'aiti Sultanate will be able to establish its control there."
    NWhadhramaut.2.a:0 "Our work here is done"
    
    NWhadhramaut.3.t:0 "Making peace with Kathiri"         # Harold Ingrams, sayyid Abu Bakr
    NWhadhramaut.3.desc:0 "The confrontation between Kathiri and Qu'aiti has been going on for 100 years. During this time the war has exhausted both states. Against this background, the British government sent Harold Ingrams to Hadhramaut in order to secure a truce between the two sultanates. In turn, the famous merchant and public benefactor Sayyid Abu Bakr offered to devote a large share of his fortune to peace payments to the warring tribes.
    NWhadhramaut.3.a:0 "It is time to establish peace in the region"
    NWhadhramaut.3.b:0 "No peace with our sworn enemies"
    
    NWhadhramaut.4.t:0 "Peace with the Qu'aiti"
    
    NWhadhramaut.5.t:0 "Signing the Consultative Treaty"
    NWhadhramaut.5.desc:0 "A few days ago the British government demanded that we sign a consultative treaty. This means that our sultan will be obliged to listen to all the "advice" of the British representative in the country. Thus [GetNameDef] will fall in line with the states of the Western Aden Protectorate, which have effectively lost their autonomy."
    NWhadhramaut.5.a:0 "We have no other option."
    NWhadhramaut.5.b:0 "There is no way we will accept this proposal."
    
    NWhadhramaut.6.t:0 "signs advisory agreement"
    NWhadhramaut.6.desc:0 "After signing the «Ingrams' Peace», our colonial authorities in the eastern Aden Protectorate managed to convince [From.GetAdjective] Sultan to sign an advisory treaty that effectively removes what remains of his independence."
    NWhadhramaut.6.a:0 "Glorious"
    
    NWhadhramaut.7.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] resistance."
    NWhadhramaut.7.desc:0 "Even after signing the «Ingrams' Peace», our colonial authorities in the eastern Aden Protectorate failed to impose [From.GetAdjective] an advisory treaty on the Sultan. [From.GetName] was unwilling to place the country under the full control of our administration."
    NWhadhramaut.7.a:0 "We should make a small show of force"
    NWhadhramaut.7.b:0 "Well, if he won't..."
    
    NWhadhramaut.8.t:0 "Transfer of Aden"         # Government of India Act
    NWhadhramaut.8.desc:0 "Under the Government of India Act of 1935, the city of Aden on the Gulf of Aden is to be withdrawn from India and made a separate colony. Today the document goes into effect and we are to cede Aden to Great Britain."
    NWhadhramaut.8.a:0 "Aden will be transfer to Britain."
    NWhadhramaut.8.b:0 "This part of the act should be revised."
    
    NWhadhramaut.9.desc:0 "Under the Indian Administration Act of 1935 the city of Aden on the Gulf of Aden is to be withdrawn from India and made a separate colony. This document came into force today, in view of which the Indian authorities have transferred control of the city to us."
