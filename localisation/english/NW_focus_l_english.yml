    SOV_abandon_wheeled_tracked_scheme_desc:0 "It is worth admitting that our work in the field of converting all types of tanks to a wheeled-tracked course has only led to an increase in the cost and complication of their design, while one of the important reasons for using such a suspension ceases to bother us, since the new types of tracks are much more reliable than they were back in the late 20s."
