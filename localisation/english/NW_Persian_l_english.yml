An emergency plenum of the Central Committee was convened today where, during a dispute, one member of the assembly blamed the honorary general secretary of the party, and his brother, the de facto leader of the party.\n\nResponding, the general secretary replied that if they were not confident in his leadership, they could start voting against his candidacy for the position of general secretary. Immediately the vote, to the surprise of the Eskanderi brothers, resulted in their removal from office. With this news, Khalil Maleki entered the hall, accompanied by a few members of the Third Force, with which he managed to convince the members of the Central Committee that he was right and achieve the removal of the current leaders.\n\nThe same day a decree was issued by which the Eskanderi brothers and particularly close supporters of pro-Soviet policies were expelled from the country. Apparently, Iran now faces its own path, independent of other countries."

When Keshavarz read the plan in parliament, one conservative rose from his seat and shouted: «It's against Islam. It is against the Holy Quran. It is contrary to the restrictions set by Islam to behave against the Koran and the religion of Islam».\n\nThe next night, Molotov cocktails were thrown into the reader's office, causing a fire.
