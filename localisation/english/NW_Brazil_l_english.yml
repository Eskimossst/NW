Throughout the Old Republic, the latifundi were decomposing from within as a result of the exodus of population and peasant uprisings. In the past, during the reign of Pedro II (1831-1889), the peasantry remained absolutely subordinate to the landowners. Each planter had its own militia, which was responsible for maintaining order within its territory and controlled the peasants."
