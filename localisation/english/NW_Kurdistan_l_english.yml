They took a special path aimed at creating a strong state, and this is based on a revolutionary ideology – fascism. This can also be implemented here, and the first step for rallying the people and forming the nation is the creation of a certain Fascist council. However, not all world politicians welcome this."

    NWkurd.27.t:0 "Ideas of Socialism"
    NWkurd.27.desc:0 "The Soviet Union impresses all modern states with its achievements in economics and science. The Russians have achieved such significant success thanks to the so-called idea of socialism.

    NWkurd.35.desc:0 "The bourgeois government of the Ararat Republic of Kurdistan, born out of a petty-peasant uprising in eastern Turkey, today issued a shameful statement: their authoritarian president [From.GetLeader] claims that Mount Ararat is their symbol and their property, and no other nation allegedly has the right to use them.\n\nIt would be ridiculous if they did not descend to the behavior of a typical fascist gathering: the Kurds demand that we remove the eternal symbol of the Armenian people, Mount Ararat, from the coat of arms of the Armenian SSR."
    NWkurd.35.a:0 "In fact, there is a grain of truth in this"

    NWkurd.38.desc:0 "The Government of the Ararat Republic of Kurdistan today issued a statement that only their sovereignty extends to Mount Ararat, a sacred symbol for us.\n\nSuch a statement could not but alarm us.
