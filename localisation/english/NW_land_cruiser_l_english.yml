    land_cruiser_category:0 "The Concept of Land Cruisers"
    land_cruiser_category_desc:0 "Analysis of the use of armored units on the fields of the Great War, as well as modern global trends, gave rise in our country just a wave of different proposals to improve the armored power of our army. Some of them look completely absurd, others may contain really rational ideas, but still can not qualify for serial replication. These proposals include the «tank cruiser» project.\nWith sufficient scientific and technical capacity, we can begin the step-by-step realization.\n"

    ### EVENTS
    NWland_cruiser.1.t:0 "Applicability of Ship's Guns"
    NWland_cruiser.1.desc:0 "Our designers were able to adapt the ship's weapons to the "land cruiser" design. However, to optimize the load on the frame, it was decided to remove one of the three guns and the associated charging mechanism - the removal of the third gun allowed to place additional ammunition and reduce the total weight of the tank by 50 tons.\n\nThus a twin 28-cm naval artillery gun, which can fire ammunition developed for other naval guns, will enter as the main armament. The ammunition includes armor-piercing shells weighing 330 kg with 8.1 kg (18 lb) of explosive and fragmentation shells weighing 315 kg with 17.1 kg (38 lb) of explosive."

    NWland_cruiser.2.t:0 "Applicability of Heavy Weapons of Railway Guns"
    NWland_cruiser.2.desc:0 "Our designers were able to adapt the heavy weapons of railroad guns to the design of a "land cruiser. However, we must understand that we are talking about creating an armored unit based on a full railroad gun, which in turn weighs about 500 tons. The designers do not see any possibility to expand the firepower due to the heavy weight overloading.\n\nThus, the main armament will be an 800 mm artillery gun, the shell of which has a mass of 7 tons with 700 kg of explosives."
    NWland_cruiser.2.a:0 "Excellent"
    
    NWland_cruiser.3.t:0 "Multi-tower Layout"
    NWland_cruiser.3.desc:0 "The image of the designed "land cruiser" is seen by our designers as a tank with a paired main gun, reinforced by several more smaller turrets and an abundance of anti-aircraft guns on the engine deck.\n\n\n Thus, we are able to place at least one more additional caliber."

    NWland_cruiser.4.t:0 "Single-barrel layout"
    NWland_cruiser.4.desc:0 "The choice in favor of using heavy railroad guns does not leave our designers with options for the layout of the projected "land cruiser," which see it as a huge SAU with one powerful main gun. The choice made does not actually allow the specimen to be reinforced with more turrets or anti-aircraft guns."
    
    NWland_cruiser.5.t:0 "Applicability of Ship Armor"
    NWland_cruiser.5.desc:0 "Protecting such a grandiose machine is a non-trivial task and requires a significant investment. Line battleships are the closest in spirit to armor, and it seemed quite logical for our designers to attempt to apply the armor schemes to the designed tank. It was decided to provide 150-360 mm (5.9-14.2 in.) armor, with the main emphasis on frontal armor, to ensure a proper level of protection."

    land_cruiser_armor_status_green_tt:0 "§GSolves the problem of armor.§!\n"
    
    NWland_cruiser.6.t:0 "Results of the chassis researches"
    NWland_cruiser.6.desc:0 "Our designers faced an almost impossible task - to make a thousand-ton tank move. But through the combined efforts of the various design bureaus, we managed to find design solutions for the running gear. This means that now all we have to do is to design and build the transmission, engine and tracks, as the requirements to these elements in the context of the whole tank are already known.\nCalculations show that a hydromechanical transmission with torsion suspension would be suitable for such an armored vehicle.\nAs an engine it is proposed to use 2-4 ship engines of about 24 000 hp each. The engines must be equipped with snorkels, the tubes of which are designed to allow oxygen access to the engine even during hypothetical amphibious operations in deep water. The enormous weight would have to be distributed over the ground using six tracks 1.2 meters (3 feet 11 inches) wide and 21 meters (69 feet) long, together forming two composite tracks 3.6 meters (11 feet 10 inches) wide each.\nThis would help improve stability and weight distribution, but the total mass of the «land cruiser» would destroy roads and make bridge crossings nearly impossible. The overall height and ground clearance of 2 m (6.6 ft.) is expected to allow most rivers to be waded relatively easily, eliminating the need for bridge crossings."

    NWland_cruiser.7.desc:0 "Our engineers and designers managed the impossible! The land cruiser project has been brought to metal, and now our enemies can only sympathize."

The shortcomings we found were not so critical and are quite correctable.\n\nToday, [GetDateText] today, we received information about preparations for the start of firing tests of the specimen. The results will give us valuable experience in the design of similar vehicles."
