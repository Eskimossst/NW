    OMA_proshiite_reforms_desc:0 "Most of the people of the sheikhs of Harami and Falati come from the Shiite province of Al Batinah and they are not as tolerant of other Muslim denominations as the overthrown Ibadite dynasty of Al Said.

    OMA_spy_training:0 "Train the Spies"
    OMA_spy_training_desc:0 "Sheikh Harami knows very well how to train good spies and spies. His skills have previously come in handy in tribal wars and rebellion against the Sultan, now it's time to use them against hostile nations."

    OMA_gazavat:0 "Gazavat"
    OMA_gazavat_desc:0 "There are still many Muslim countries around us, ruled by Christian colonisers or unrighteous tyrants.

    OMA_matrakh_expansionism_desc:0 "The deposed sultan was not at all concerned about the greatness of his state, he was content with being a protectorate of the British Empire. But now the time has come to make our country an important player in the region again."

    OMA_subjugate_sultanates_of_hadramaut_desc:0 "Kathiri, Qu'aiti and Mahra, the great sultanates of Hadhramaut, have long since lost their independence and former power. These states and their adjoining minor sultanates, emirates and sheikhdoms would make excellent additions to our lands."
    OMA_subjugate_sheikhs_of_treaty_oman:0 "Subjugate the Sheikhs of Trucial Oman"
    OMA_subjugate_sheikhs_of_treaty_oman_desc:0 "The so-called «Trucial Coast» was under the control of the sultans of Muscat until 1820, when Britain forced the local emirs and sheikhs to give up Oman and sign the «truces» which gave rise to the «Trucial Oman».

    OMA_strengthening_ties_with_sheikh_qajimi_desc:0 "Gokaldas Khimji, the only Indian who has been granted the title of Sheikh, is one of the most influential traders involved in the transit of goods between India and Muscat.

    OMA_strengthening_anglo_muscat_cooperation_desc:0 "Although many people are dissatisfied with the presence of the British in the country, it cannot be overlooked that it is thanks to them that our country has had civilisation which we could not have known before, and that the United Kingdom provides us with a reliable defence against any foreign invasion.

    OMA_restoring_health_system:0 "Restore the Healthcare System"
    OMA_restoring_health_system_desc:0 "During the years of Said bin Taimur's rule, the rudiments of a healthcare system were effectively destroyed by the country's policy of isolation from the outside world.

    OMA_restoring_education_system:0 "Restore the Education System"
    OMA_restoring_education_system_desc:0 "Until now, educational institutions in our country could be counted on the fingers of one hand. We should look into the creation of a global education system that will enable everyone in our country to learn."

However, relations between the British representatives in the country and the sultan have become increasingly strained in recent years. His Majesty's displeasure has been caused by British interference in the internal affairs of the country and their unwillingness to contribute to Muscat's defensive capacity in the face of the Omani threat. The Sultan may therefore refuse to renew the treaty of friendship with Britain."
    OMA_renegotiation_of_anglo_muscat_treaty_of_friendship_tt1:0 "§HThe Anglo-Muscat Friendship Treaty is renewed in November of each year. In order to gain actual independence, we can demand a revision of this agreement, threatening to refuse to renew it altogether.§!\n"

    OMA_fight_against_everything_decadent_desc:0 "Said bin Taimur disdains many «achievements» of Western civilisation. The willful sultan can ban anything, from European dancing to radio."

    OMA_limited_modernization_desc:0 "Said bin Taimur has never sought to radically improve the lives of his people, despising many of the achievements of modern times.

    NWmuscat.43.desc:0 "After Sheikh Harami overthrew the sultan of Muscat and destroyed the last pockets of resistance of the Al-Said dynasty, our chances of regaining influence in the region were greatly diminished. Against this background, representatives of the rebellious sheikh offered us peace and recognition of the new government in Muscat and Muttrah."
    
    NWmuscat.44.t:0 "The Sultan of Muscat Wants to Revise the Treaty"
    NWmuscat.44.desc:0 "After the suppression of the Sheikh Harami uprising, the Sultan of Muscat [OMA.GetLeader] announced his desire to revise the treaty that established the British protectorate over the sultanate.\n\nThis news came as a surprise to our government. The treaty with Muscat is renewed in November each year, and the Sultan could simply refuse to renew the agreement. For us, this would considerably weaken our sphere of influence in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that we have not been able to achieve total subjugation of Muscat and our political leverage over Muscat is very limited, and we can only justifiably use force if the Sultan unilaterally tears up the treaty. Although we should take into account that formally Muscat's independence is guaranteed by France and the United States."

We must choose on what terms we will insist.\n\nSultan intends to substantially limit the powers of the British advisers, which will make the country effectively independent. At the same time [Root.GetLeader] wishes to continue to maintain close allied relations with the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, perhaps we should ensure ourselves greater independence in foreign policy by refusing to follow British advice in foreign policy."

Otherwise, the Sultan threatens to refuse to sign an extension of the treaty. But accepting these conditions would lead to Muscat's de facto independence, although it would still remain within our sphere of influence."

Otherwise the Sultan threatens to refuse to sign the extension of the treaty. But acceptance of these conditions would lead to Muscat's de facto independence, and would enable it subsequently to leave our sphere of influence altogether."

    NWmuscat.55.desc:0 "The city of Gwadar has belonged to the Sultans of Muscat for centuries, but now the [From.GetAdjective] authorities, due to a serious lack of finances, have expressed their desire to sell us the city."

With the mediation of the British Empire, the Treaty of Seb was concluded between the parties, ending the armed confrontation.\n\nThe Sultan [From.GetLeader] finally decided to regain control over the internal territories and started a war with the Imamate.\n\nSince Muscat is our protectorate, we can help him in the war, although the sparsely populated Oman already has little chance to stand against the British-trained troops of the Sultan."

However, the realities of today's world require a clearer distribution of the territories under control. In this regard, representatives of Muscat have proposed the demarcation of the state border between the countries."
    NWmuscat.59.a:0 "This is a sensible suggestion"
