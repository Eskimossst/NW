 Newfoundland.2.desc:0 "The vast lands of Western Labrador are the most poorly studied areas of the country, yet the government was already aware of the presence of a large iron deposit there, but its development required a better study of the area. To do this, an expedition was sent to the region, which mapped the territory and studied the prospects for the development of the field."

 Newfoundland.7.t:0 "A Difficult Story"
 Newfoundland.7.desc:0 "Newfoundland had a responsible government, meaning it had its own Parliament and Cabinet responsible to it since 1854, but officially became a dominion in 1907 at the same time as New Zealand. When the war broke out, the government equipped and sent a single regiment to the front, which was nevertheless a significant contribution for such a small island nation. The Newfoundland regiment performed heroically in battle, for which it received the status of a Royal regiment and became the pride of the people of Newfoundland. However, after the war, pension obligations to veterans, along with the debt for the construction of the trans-island railway, became a serious burden on the budget.\n\nAlthough the 20s proved to be a time of relative prosperity for Newfoundland, the country was rocked by political scandals: in 1923, the attorney general arrested the prime minister of Newfoundland, sir Richard Squires, on charges of corruption. Despite his release soon on bail, the British-led Hollis Walker commission examined the scandal. Squires returned to power in 1928 due to the unpopularity of his successors, but found himself at the head of a state suffering from a global crisis.\n\nAs a small country that relied heavily on exports of fish, paper, and minerals, Newfoundland was severely affected by the great depression, which had accumulated huge debts, went into complete financial ruin. The crisis was so deep that in 1934, on the recommendation of Lord Amulry's Royal commission, Newfoundland's self-government was abolished and a special commission appointed by London came to power. Conceived as a temporary facility, it consists of three British and three Newfoundland politicians, under the chairmanship of the governor."

 Newfoundland.8.t:0 "Newfoundland Government Commission"
 Newfoundland.8.desc:0 "Newfoundland was granted dominion status in 1907 at the same time as New Zealand. However, in 1934, as a result of the global economic crisis, the economy of Newfoundland came to a complete financial collapse - so deep that at the request of the dominion government, its independence was canceled and Newfoundland returned to the status of a colony under the management of a special commission appointed by London, headed by the country's governor, admiral sir David Murray Anderson. He generally performed well, but despite his newfound powers, Anderson took the position of a neutral mediator, intervening only in the event of dispute in the commission. His approach proved insufficient to lead the government out of minor conflicts, and in October 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another naval officer, sir Humphrey Walwyn. However, we still have the opportunity to change the candidacy of the new governor and chairman of the commission. In particular, we can appoint a Pro-British Gordon MacDonald, although this may displease the Newfoundland people."

However, despite his newfound powers, Anderson took the position of a neutral mediator, intervening only in the event of a dispute in the commission. His approach was not enough to lead the government out of minor disputes and conflicts, and in october 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another naval officer, sir Humphrey Walwyn, who today officially takes office as governor and head of the government commission."

His approach was not enough to lead the government out of minor disputes and conflicts, and in october 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another naval officer, sir Humphrey Walwyn. However, at the last moment, the British government changed its decision and appointed a very Pro-British Gordon MacDonald as governor and head of the commission.\nThis fact outraged the population of Newfoundland. Two days after MacDonald's arrival, an apparently congratulatory poem was published in the Evening Telegram. However, it turned out that the poem was an acrostic, with the first letters of each line forming the word Bastard."

 Newfoundland.11.t:0 "Newfoundland Royal Regiment"
 Newfoundland.11.desc:0 "During the Great war, Newfoundland formed a single regiment, named the Blue Windings for the color of its windings, which stood out strongly against soldiers from other parts of the British Empire. In the battle of Gallipoli and the battle on the Somme, the regiment suffered huge losses, but for heroic service received the status of a Royal.\nAlthough the regiment was disbanded at the end of the war, its memory lives deep in the hearts of newfoundlanders. To raise the patriotic spirit of the population, the government decided to re-create a military unit called the Royal Newfoundland regiment. However, it may be that it will be more effective if its number is raised to a division."

 Newfoundland.17.t:0 "Issue of Concessions"
 Newfoundland.17.desc:0 "The Newfoundland governing commission is looking for any way to restore the country's economy. In particular, the governor recently proposed that concessions in Labrador be leased to the United States. This will help bring foreign investment to the country and develop unpopulated Labrador land. However, it may also strengthen Pro-American sentiment in Newfoundland.\nHowever the commission is responsible to the British government and in this regard we have every right to prohibit the granting of concessions."

 Newfoundland.22.t:0 "Resistance to Reform"
 Newfoundland.22.desc:0 "When the commission came to power in 1934, the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Methodist churches played a central role in the administration of education. The new government made many efforts to eliminate the denominational educational system and replace it with a secular one. In particular, a number of public schools were opened, and the curriculum, which was previously too academic and focused on learning rather that understanding, was reformed. However, the government's further efforts encountered resistance from the churches. Many commissioners fear that further changes will be extremely unpopular and cause widespread discontent among the people."

 Newfoundland.22.b:0 "The reform will be carried out despite the discontent of the radicals"
 
 Newfoundland.23.t:0 "Conflict with Farmers"
 Newfoundland.23.desc:0 "Tensions between farmers involved in the land settlement program have been growing for a long time. Many settlers feel that the state controls their lives too much and manages their communities too closely. Some claim that they even need to ask permission to invite friends and relatives to their communities to visit. Other have become uneasy because they do not own the land they live on and cultivate. They worry that the government will order them to leave if it becomes dissatisfied with their work or behavior.\nA turning point was when the state trustees evicted a couple from Markland, the largest settlement created under the program, for refusing to send their children to a local school, which was set up under the program of so-called Folk Schools that were non-denominational in nature and taught carpentry, agriculture, natural science, civil law, and many other subjects. The eviction of this couple provoked discontent among the settlers, seven of them openly opposed the decision."

 Newfoundland.23.b:0 "Those who oppose the government's decision should also be evicted"
 Newfoundland.24.t:0 "New Problems"
 Newfoundland.24.desc:0 "Despite a promising start, the program of settling the territory soon had to face considerable amount of difficulties. There are growing contraditions between farmers and officials. Fiction also arose between settlers, especially when working on communal farms. Some people felt they were doing more work than their neighbors, who were still getting an equal share of the profits. A few of the older settlers were annoyed by the fact that the newcomers have immediately benefited from the work, after which it took them months. But the most important problems remained the country's rugged terrain, acidic soils, rather poor climate, and a shortage of local markets, which, combined with the inexperience of Newfoundland farmers, negatively affects the efficiency of agricultural development.\nIn this regard, the government has doubts that the program can be crowned with success, especially since public spending is constantly growing."
 Newfoundland.24.a:0 "Eliminating dependence on the fishing industry is not worth the investment"
 Newfoundland.24.b:0 "It is necessary to continue funding the program"
 Newfoundland.25.t:0 "New Problems"
 Newfoundland.25.desc:0 "It was expected that the settlers under the land settlement program would cultivate the territory and work on public projects. They don't earn cash, but instead get credit at state-owned stores in their area of residence. Although each family has its own farm, they must also cultivate a large plot of common land, from which they must share the profits. The government viewed the land settlement program as a social experiment that it hoped would make participants more self-sufficient and less dependent on government support, as well as destroy their old community and religious ties. However, officials are increasingly doubtful that the settlers will ever be able to fully support themselves, let alone repay the government loan. In addition, the government has already spent much more on the program than planned."

 Newfoundland.25.b:0 "We believe that sooner or later success will come and the costs will be justified"
 
 Newfoundland.26.t:0 "Newfoundland Loggers"
 Newfoundland.26.desc:0 "During the war, many patriotic newfoundlanders who were not conscripted went to the mother country to help us fight the common enemy. In particular, more than 3600 loggers from Newfoundland's overseas forestry sector have arrived in our forests so far. These people supply wood to help build the frames of coal mines, telegraph poles, and ships, or to restore bombing fortifications."

 Newfoundland.27.t:0 "Dissatisfaction with the Commission"
 Newfoundland.27.desc:0 "The government commission has been in power for a long time, but during this time, the people of Newfoundland have not felt much change in their lives. Although the commission was significantly more effective than the corrupt government of the dominion, due to limited finances, it was not able to significantly improve the situation in the country. The commissioners cannot meet the unrealistic demands of the people of Newfoundland and consequently lose their support. There are growing calls for the restoration of self-government and free elections."

The commissioners have made mant efforts to restore the country's economy, but they have not been able to achieve significant success. In this regard, more and more people began to demand the restoration of the status of the dominion and the holding of democratic elections. Having lost the last popular support, the commission decided to resign."

However, recently, a private figure skating party was organized at the arena with the participation of military personnel. At 19:20, a fire broke out in the boiler room, and very quickly the wooden structure was completely engulfed in flames. Spectacular flames lit up the city at night. The main ice arena in St. John's and the adjacent Curling area burned to the ground."

 Newfoundland.30.desc:0 "During the war, Newfoundland was filled with military personnel. To create recreation areas for soldiers, the Knights of Columbus Catholic organization built a major sleep, nutrition, and recreation center for military personnel in St. John's. It included a reading room, a restaurant, restrooms, showers, a Dorm where men could stay, and a recreation room. The entertainment center was a large auditorium equipped with a stage for live performances and a projection both for showing films.\nApproximately 400 people attended the dance in the hall where Biddy O'Toole's songs were broadcast. Shortly after the beginning of the next act, a fire started in the building. The crowd struggled to get out of the hall, but the lights went out because of the fire. Four exists were blocked due to a power outage.\nA total of 99 people were killed, including 80 military personnel and 19 civilians. Another 109 people were seriously injured. It was the fastest and deadliest fire at that time in the pages of Newfoundland history."

 Newfoundland.31.t:0 "Fall of Great Britain"
 Newfoundland.31.desc:0 "The commission came to power to replace the corrupt Newfoundland government, but its functioning was entirely based on the British government. In the light of recent events, ties with the UK were lost, and the commissioners faced a choice: either ask for patronage from Canada and continue their reforms, or resign, returning the country to democracy.

 Newfoundland.33.b:0 "Why we need Newfoundland?"
 Newfoundland.34.t:0 "Canadian Response"

 Newfoundland.35.t:0 "Convocation of the National Assembly"
 Newfoundland.35.desc:0 "Shortly after the government announced the National Assembly, ten committees were set up to study various aspects of the country's economy and society. When they submit reports to the Assembly, it will send recommendations to the British government on the options for the fate of the country, which will be in the referendum.\n\nHowever, in the beginning, it is necessary to decide whether to broadcast the debates of the National Assembly on the radio. The broadcast of the discussions will lead to the fact that everything said at the meeting will have a greater effect on the people of the country, and, consequently, on their decision in the referendum. If the debate is not broadcast, any undesirable ideas expressed by delegates will have less impact on the people."

However, this orderly program was disrupted when Joseph Smallwood stated that the Assembly should send a delegation to Ottawa to fing out the possible terms of the union. Smallwood was one of the few members who openly supported Confederation (the traditional name for joining Canada, which was originally a confederation of colonies). His movement found only 17 supporters and sparked a fierce debate that polarized delegates.\nIf the National Assembly does send a delegation to Ottawa to discuss the country's possible accession to Canada, the Confederate movement may have a strong case for its ideas and may have a better chance of winning the referendum. But in the same time, the annexation of Newfoundland does not bring Canada any financial benefits, and therefore, there is a high chance that Ottawa will reject the idea of annexing the island or offer unfavorable conditions, thereby hitting the confederate positions."

Delegates from the island, who believed that the country should still join Canada, sent a delegation to Ottawa to discuss the terms of a possible union.\nIf we offer Newfoundland benefits when joining, the people of this country will have a great chance to vote for joining Canada in a referendum. On the other hand, joining the island will not bring us financial benefits, but rather will force us to spend more. But at the same time, by annexing the island, we will prevent the growth of Pro-American sentiment on it."

If we now declare that British assistance will cease after the restoration of dominion status, newfoundlanders will be less willing to vote for the return of self-government. In addition, Pro-American sentiment is growing on the island, and if Newfoundland again becomes a self-governing dominion, its government may move closer to the United States. On the other hand, Newfoundland is a full member of the British Commonwealth, and there are many loyalists loyal to the crown among its inhabitants, and the mother country should not leave them without support while the island's economy is still recovering from years of crisis."

Many members of the government are already interested in this proposal, but we can also demand to provide us with military bases on the island. But it is worth considering that the final fate of Newfoundland will be decided in a referendum and the demand for the bases may alienate people from the already not very popular option of an economic union with the United States."

However, we may not hold a referendum, which, however, will cause discontent in the people, and let the Assembly decide for itself the fate of the country, which will surely decide to return Newfoundland to the status of a dominion. On the other hand, the options that will be allowed in the referendum are determined by the British government, which allows us to exclude undesirable options without violating the previously stated order."

However, suddenly Great Britain decided to entrust this decision directly to the National Assembly.\n\nFrom the beginning of the meeting, it was always dominated by supporters of restoring the status of the dominion. For this reason, in the vote on the future fate of the country, most of the delegates voted for the option of returning to responsible government, and, despite a number of popular protests demanding a referendum, Newfoundland officially became a full dominion again.

They believe that it is worth inspiring the people as if only within Canada the island will not have to fear a new crisis due to the possibility of receiving financial assistance from Ottawa, and the restoration of the status of the Dominion will in turn leave Newfoundland alone with its problems and plunge the country into scandals and a new crisis.\n\nAt the same time, many members of the Association of Confederates believe that the main slogan should be «British Union with British Canada», betting on Newfoundland loyalists, as well as accusing the League of Responsible Government of republican sentiment and disloyalty to the throne. In addition, such a position would be supported by the Orange Order, which consists of a large proportion of the population of the country.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that perhaps the best solution for the confederates would be to rely on the Roman Catholic Church, which consists of just over half of the inhabitants of Newfoundland.

He criticized the Confederate movement, which he considers artificially created by the British, in order to "sell" Newfoundland to a Western neighbor. Moreover, he claimed that the island had always had a strong economy, so it did not need anyone's guardianship, be it Britain or Canada. His speech, although quite radical and not entirely related to reality, was supported by a number of league members who proposed that Hollet's position be made the official position of the party.\n\nWas followed by Albert Boyle Butt who put forward his proposals for the league company in a referendum. In his opinion, it is necessary to convince the population that joining Canada is not profitable, that it will bring only new taxes, prevent the export of Newfoundland goods and that Ottawa is not interested in economic assistance to the island. By doing so, Butt hopes to convince people to vote in favour of a return to domination status.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, a group of members of the League of Responsible Governments proposed a company called "Don't sell your country!" to remind people of the glorious moments in the island's history, including the exploits of Newfoundlanders in the Great War fields, and the economic achievements of the 20s. In this way, politicians hope to raise patriotic sentiment in Newfoundland.\n\nThe outcome of the discussion will be for the leadership of the anti-Confederate movement to decide on their campaigning in the referendum."

If they feel that their chances of winning are slim, the best solution is to go for a tactical alliance with the League of Responsible Government. Such a move would increase the chances for both factions to win by weakening the confederates' position.

 NFL_policy_of_commission_of_government:0 "Policy of Government's Commission"
 NFL_policy_of_commission_of_government_desc:0 "Since 1934, Newfoundland has been governed by unelected commissioners appointed from Great Britain. While the commission is in power, recommendations and financial assistance are regularly received from London. In addition, the fact that the commissioners are appointed from Britain significantly reduces the level of corruption in the state apparatus. All this makes it possible to reform the country more effectively and contributes to a faster way out of the crisis.\n\nIf the support of the commissioners falls below 25%, they will be forced to resign and call the National Assembly. The new government will be able to continue the policy of the commissioners, but the costs will be much higher."

 NFL_grant_concessions_to_us_desc:0 "Labrador is still a sparsely populated and poorly developed region.

 NFL_Raise_teachers_salaries_desc:0 "When C.A. Richardson, a school inspector from England, surveyed Newfoundland schools in 1933, he was shocked to find that children were being taught by malnourished teachers. Government officials recognized the need for further pay increases for teachers, because many experienced teachers were leaving to work in other, better-paid jobs."

To improve education the government should create a secular education system."
 NFL_land_settlement_scheme:0 "Land settlement program"
 NFL_land_settlement_scheme_desc:0 "The development of agriculture is one of the ways to eliminate dependence on the fishing industry. A main role in this will be played by the settlement program, which involves the relocation of families to previously uninhabited land provided by the state, on which settlers will build their farms. The government also provides loans to families and sets up public schools and shops in new villages. According to the commissioners plans the new farms should pay off in a few years and create the basis for the expansion of Newfoundland agriculture."
 NFL_Fight_corruption:0 "Fight with corruption"
 NFL_Fight_corruption_desc:0 "The state apparatus of Newfoundland before the commission came to power was extremely corrupt.

 NFL_policy_of_responsible_government_desc:0 "Newfoundland is once again governed by a government responsible to Parliament. The return to democracy was welcomed by the people, but at the same time corruption and political scandals returned to the country.\n\nThe new government can continue the reforms initiated by the government commission, but it will have to face the lack of external assistance and incompetence of some of the elected politicians. These facts make the implementation of reforms more expensive than under the commission."

 NFL_National_Convention_desc:0 "If the government commission resigns or decides that the country's economy has recovered sufficiently from the crisis, the national Assembly should be called. Its purpose will be to formulate recommendations to the British government on possible options for the future of the country, which will be presented in a national referendum in Newfoundland.\n\nAt the moment, only options for removing the power of the commission and restoring responsible government (that is, returning to parliamentary democracy and dominion status) are assumed, but there are also forces in the country that believe that Newfoundland should become part of Canada, which it has repeatedly refused to do. In addition, the country is increasingly spreading the idea of a closer relationship with the United States."
