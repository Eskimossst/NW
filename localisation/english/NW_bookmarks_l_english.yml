 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War put an end to the existence of the giant Ottoman Empire, which dominates in the Middle East, but Turkey itself avoided being torn apart between the Entente countries - Mustafa Kemal made a national revolution and built a republic on the ruins of a monarchical state.\n\nNow the state is stable and it's time to evaluate it the situation and decide with whom to go further - with the former enemies in the face of Britain or with the aggressive German Reich of Hitler."

 POR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Salazar successfully showed itself in the Spanish Civil War and suppressed all sorts of speeches of left radicals.\n\nThe current task of the National Union is to determine the country's foreign policy orientation, because the wrong choice will threaten the very existence of Portugal..."

 LIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For many years now, the true Whig party has dominated the country, keeping other groups out of power.\nThe Approaching world war will give us new opportunities, depending on which side we take, the Allies or the Axis? But active fighting requires soldiers, and the tribes may not agree to forced recruitment, setting up a new uprising, which we may not be able to suppress on our own, and we will have to turn to Germany, accepting the help of our Consul in Germany."

 NFL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny island nation flourished in the post-war years. However, the Great depression that began in 1929 turned into an economic collapse for the dominion of Newfoundland. The dependence on salted fish exports, coupled with huge debts, led to a crisis so deep that in 1934 the country was forced to cancel its self-government and become a colony again, remaining a dominion in name only. Nevertheless, the people have the right to call for a referendum that will decide the future of Newfoundland. Will it become a dominion again? Or maybe the people would like to be reunited with Canada? Or maybe Pro American sentiment will prevail on the island."

 YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Yemen gained full independence, but its power was shaken after the failed war with Saudi Arabia.

 BPL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the end of the great war, Britain received a League of Nations mandate to govern Palestine, a troubled Jewish - Arab region. Initially, London declared its desire to create a Jewish state on its mandated territory, but now it is retreating from these positions.\nThe tension in the country is growing and if you do not take steps to resolve the situation, then Palestine will explode, engulfing the entire Middle East."

 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iraq was a subject territory of the British Empire after the great war, but it defended its independence while maintaining British influence inside.

 BMD_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Bermuda is 150 small Islands located in the center of the Atlantic ocean and forgotten by everyone except the locals. However, despite this characteristic, it is Bermuda that is the main base of the Royal Navy in the Western Atlantic, without which it is impossible to communicate the United Kingdom with the colonies in America. The Bermuda flag has already flown in the sky over Europe in the great war, so it is foolish to expect that a new war in Europe will do without these proud little people."
 
 EGY_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "For several years now, Egypt has been rid of the humiliating British protectorate, but this has not yet secured the country's independence. The British armed forces still have military bases throughout the country, in fact, control the Sudan, and the king's health leaves much to be desired. It is obvious that the king will not last long, and further policy will depend on his young heir once he is crowned. Will it make mistakes, will it bend under the British colonial machine, or will it be able to choose a decent government that will be able to defend the country in these difficult years?"
 
 NEP_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Having overthrown the Shah dynasty, the Rana did not eliminate the Royal dynasty, leaving it a figurehead of «power». The victors of the court intrigues themselves concentrated power on the post of Prime Minister, who had full power. Fearing foreign intervention, the country remained closed for many years, leaving only the British representation after the defeat of the British. Being isolated, the country is noticeably behind the rest of the world, but ties with the UK and the course of the new Minister will correct this shortcoming in the shortest possible time. But will the oppositionists calmly await their fate at this time, whether in favor of the people or the king?"
 
 BHU_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "For 200 years Bhutan was actually in a state of continuous civil war, and only at the beginning of the twentieth century Ugyen Wangchuck was able to reunite and strengthen the country, founding a new dynasty. In 1910 he signed the Treaty of Punakha with Britain, under which the latter guaranteed independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of Bhutan, but took control over the foreign policy of the kingdom.\nNow Bhutan is ruled by Jigme Wangchuck, continuing the policy of his father to centralize and modernize the state.

 SKM_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "During its history, Sikkim has been under Tibetan, Nepalese, and Bhutanese rule. Now it is a small Himalayan Kingdom is a protectorate of Great Britain. The interests of the British in the country are limited to trade with Tibet through its territory, which is why the local feudal lords retained their power and even strengthened it. The conservative nobility strongly hinders the development of the country, but the people will not forever tolerate cruel feudal exploitation..."
 
 TIB_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Tibet was once a great empire whose collapse gave rise to a unique culture and Buddhism. With the decline of the empire, Tibet fell under the Chinese sphere of influence, and only British support saved it from becoming another puppet of the Kuomintang. The death of the XIII Dalai Lama was followed by a political crisis, at the end of which a regent was identified, and it would seem that nothing could threaten the country's peace, except that a party adhering to the positions of the Kuomintang began to gain strength in the country. The few leftist supporters are pushing for an uprising in Xikang, and the regent is far from as clean as he should be for raising a new Dalai Lama."
 
 ALB_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Having survived the Ottoman rule, several coups took place in Albania, at the end of which Prime Minister Zogu took over and declared himself the new king of the Albanian kingdom.\n\nHowever, even these changes did not remedy the plight of the country, which forced the country to seek help from Italy, and drove Albania into huge debts and hung a lot of responsibilities. The choice will decide the future policy, will we follow the course of Italy, or will we go our own way?"
 
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark was not directly involved in the Great War, but even then it had to choose between Britain and Germany, the country's two main trading partners. Choosing one side would have meant severing ties with the other, but fortunately the country managed to maintain its shaky neutrality.\n\nNow, with the economy weakened by high unemployment and Christian X's credibility undermined by his authoritarian aspirations, the Scandinavian kingdom once again has to choose which side to take, and there is no doubt that this time the Danish people will have to take up arms."
 DEN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC_DESC:0 "The threat of World War comes from Germany, the Danish kingdom's closest neighbor. Scandinavian kingdom will have to make every effort to preserve its independence - there is no doubt that the Wehrmacht, seeking to gain control of the Baltic Sea, will try to occupy Jutland and the Denmark islands..."

 SAU_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "В начале XX века казалось, что некогда могущественный род аль Сауд окончательно разгромлен и разорён. Однако в 1902 году энергичному принцу Абдул-Азизу с отрядом всего 40 человек в ходе дерзкого рейда удалось захватить Эр-Рияд. Заручившись поддержкой ихванов, воинственных осевших бедуинов, придерживающихся ваххабизма, молодой король на протяжении 30 лет вёл войны по объединению Аравии. Окончив завоевания и подавив восстания ихванов, желавших продолжения джихада и враждебно относившихся ко всем новшествам, Абдул-Азиз начал процесс постепенного реформирования государства..."

 IOM_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The Imamate of Oman was proclaimed in 1913 as a result of an uprising in the Sultanate of Muscat by conservative Ibadi Muslims who were dissatisfied with the strengthening of British influence in the country. In 1918, with the mediation of the United Kingdom, the Sultanate and the Imamate concluded the Treaty of Seeb, which effectively sealed the division of the country into two parts.\nWhile Muscat was mired in tribal strife, the Imamate had a chance to unite the country under its banner. But we must act quickly, before Muscat gains strength. In addition, it will probably have to make some concessions to the British, so as not to incur their wrath."
 
 OMA_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The Sultanate of Muscat once extended its influence from the southern coast of Persia to Zanzibar and Madagascar. But in the twentieth century, the once great trading empire turned into yet another British protectorate, retaining only the Indian city of Gwadar among all its overseas possessions. In addition, the uprising of Muslims in 1913 led to the proclamation of a de facto independent Imamate of Oman in the interior of the country.\nAt the moment, Muscat is still riven by tribal strife, and some sheikhs dream of overthrowing the Sultan. There is still a chance of a second war with Oman. Perhaps we should attack first, taking advantage of British support."
