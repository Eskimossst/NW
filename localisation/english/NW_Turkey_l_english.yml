    TUR_forced_tank_production_desc:0 "Sooner or later, our ideological confrontation with the Bolsheviks will develop into a full-fledged war. It is obvious that we need to find an answer to the modern miracle of military equipment-tanks. Since most of the territory of Turkey is a mountainous area with small plateaus, it makes no sense for us to focus on light and medium tanks. It is the heavy tanks that should be the answer to the Soviet threat and the key to victory in the difficult mountainous terrain."

He headed several important diplomatic missions and negotiated peace with the Entente powers. Thanks to Ataturk's unrestricted disposition he was able to quickly advance in his career, but this caused the fierce hatred of many other people in Kemal's circle.\nThe other equally important candidate is Fevzi Cakmak, the head of the Turkish General Staff, the second Field Marshal of the Republic after Ataturk himself. He retired from political activity in the 20s and devoted himself to the development of the Turkish army, thanks to which he practically did not take part in the political struggle and did not make any enemies.\nAnother possible successor could be Mahmud Caelal Bayar, a democratic party leader appointed by Ataturk as prime minister a year ago. He holds liberal economic views, is a good economic manager, he ran the Business Bank of Turkey for more than 8 years. In addition, he participated in many negotiations with European powers.\nThe dark horse could be Şukru Kaya, the permanent Minister of the Interior of the Republic, recently appointed as Secretary General of the People's Republican Party. In his main position he was engaged in suppressing Kurdish unrest in the southeast of the country, so in the current turbulent situation he will be able to keep power and maintain stability in the country."

He headed several important diplomatic missions and negotiated peace with the Entente powers. Thanks to Ataturk's unrestricted disposition he was able to quickly advance in his career, but he caused the fierce hatred of many other people in Kemal's circle.\nThe alternative seems to be Recep Peker, the developer of fascist reforms and adaptation of this ideology for our country, who currently heads the people's-republican party. This is a man with well-established views, who will be able to further carry out the modernization of the country.\nAnother equally important candidate can be called Fevzi Cakmak - the head of the Turkish General Staff, the second Field Marshal of the Republic after Ataturk himself. He left political activity in the twenties and devoted himself to the development of the Turkish army, which is why he almost never participated in political struggles and made no enemies.\nThe dark horse could be Şukru Kaya, the permanent Interior Minister of the Republic, who was recently appointed Prime Minister. In his main position, he was engaged in suppressing Kurdish unrest in the southeast of the country, so in the current turbulent situation he will be able to hold power and maintain stability in the country."
    NWturkey.80.b:0 "Let Recep complete his reforms"
    
    NWturkey.81.t:0 "Fevzi Cakmak elected as new president"
    NWturkey.81.desc:0 "The head of the Turkish Army General Staff did return to politics at the request of his old friend Ataturk. Only Fevzi Cakmak could he entrust the post of president of the republic in the event of his death. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey supported this still lifetime proposal of Kemal. In the coming new world struggle, Cakmak will be able to hold power firmly in his hands and prevent a repetition of the mistakes of the Ottoman leadership."
    NWturkey.81.a:0 "Fevzi has a lot of army experience, but not political experience..."
    
    NWturkey.82.t:0 "Mahmoud Celal Bayar elected as new president"
    NWturkey.82.desc:0 "Having received the support of Ataturk in the last years of his life, Mahmud Celal Bayar was able to gain the trust of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and take over as president of the republic. His liberal views on the economy and the state managed to resonate with Kemal. For a long time in this struggle for loyalty he fought with İsmet İnonu, but the similarity of views between Ataturk and Bayar allowed him to win."
    NWturkey.82.a:0 "A democratic future awaits Turkey after all"
    
    NWturkey.83.t:0 "Şukru Kaya elected as new president"
    NWturkey.83.desc:0 "The figure of Şukru Kaya has always been surrounded by some mystery in the government and party. Holding his position as Minister of the Interior for many years, he was apparently able to win Ataturk's favor through sheer loyalty, which led him to be promoted to even higher positions in the last months of Kemal's life. By naming him his heir before his death, Ataturk ensured Sukru's eventual victory in the presidential election, which eventually happened."
    NWturkey.83.a:0 "The intelligence services in Turkey have never been so strong"
    
    NWturkey.84.t:0 "Recep Peker elected as new president"
    NWturkey.84.desc:0 "For several years now, Recep Peker, who has been pushing fascist reforms in Turkey and trying to get better relations with other countries that have embraced this ideology, will finally be able to complete his project. Despite some disagreements with Ataturk, the latter still gave carte blanche to his close comrade, naming him his heir, thanks to which the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, under some pressure from the Fascist Council, elected him as the new president of the republic."
    NWturkey.84.a:0 "Turkish democracy died in the bud"

    NWturkey.85.t:0 "The military is consolidating its grip on power"
    NWturkey.85.desc:0 "In a long back-and-forth struggle between several factions in the republic's leadership, the military has finally succeeded in gaining control of the government and taking power. A large cabinet consists of former or acting generals loyal to Marshal Fevzi Cakmak, who has been declared the new president of the Turkish Republic."
    NWturkey.85.a:0 "He will restore order"
    NWturkey.85.b:0 "We will restore order"
    
    NWturkey.86.t:0 "The opposition wins the election"
    NWturkey.86.desc:0 "Opposition circles of politicians, supported by groups of journalists, businessmen, and the intellectual elite, succeeded in getting [Root.GetLeader] removed from office. Liberal politician Celal Mahmoud Bayar, who had been waging his own power struggle for years, was elected as the new president. Now this backroom struggle must finally come to an end, as he will continue Ataturk's course of building a democratic multi-party system, where political confrontations will be openly fought."

    NWturkey.87.t:0 "Consolidation of authoritarianism in Turkey"
    NWturkey.87.desc:0 "Despite the long confrontation and maneuvering between several political forces in the government of the republic and among its elites, the president [Root.GetLeader] managed to stay in power and finally consolidate his legitimacy. However, this also means that Turkey will apparently not be able to continue its democratic reforms and move to a multi-party system, something Ataturk dreamed of for so long."

However, our economy does not allow us to modernize both the ground army, the navy and the air force at the same time-we can only choose to do two things at once, for we do not have enough resources to do more."

    TUR_patriotism_over_internationalism_idea_desc:0 "We reject the internationalism of Trotskyism and radical Marxism in favor of a truly national form of socialism. The plight of the international worker is secondary to the struggles of the Turkish laborer, and that is what sets Kemalist-socialism apart from the more radical variants of communism."

    TUR_maximizing_military_production_idea_desc:0 "Once the whole of Europe trembled before the power of the Turkish army. However, these days are far behind us.

    TUR_backwardness_of_army_desc:0 "The Turkish army forged its sword during the long war of independence. However, its semi-partisan conditions have made their mark in the future: our army still lags behind the modern armies of Europe in quality of training and technological level of equipment. In addition, the heterogeneity of small arms creates great difficulties, which causes great logistical problems."

    TUR_put_republics_fleet_in_order_idea_desc:0 "Our country's fleet is a pitiful sight, but it was not strong even under the Ottoman Empire. It is worth realizing that it is a luxury and not every state can afford it. Or can, by cutting back on other necessities."
