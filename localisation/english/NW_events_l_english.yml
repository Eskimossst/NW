Now the wait is over: while [Root.GetRulingParty] and the army were preparing to suppress the popular uprising, [Root.GetAdjective] was placed under house arrest by several members of the government, after which they began negotiations with the rebels.\n\nThese negotiations were conducted under the pretext of maintaining public order, but in reality their task was to distribute posts in the new socialist state for those who were ready to cooperate. The coup d'etat was rapid, and all those who might have opposed the new regime were executed, arrested or exiled."

The very fact that more and more people are ready to classify themselves as belonging to some "class" shows that the ideas of Marxism-Trotskyism have not only spread among those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] mourns such a reversal of public opinion and grieves for those times when the word "[Root.GetAdjective]" was important for people. It seems that the revolution is already happening in society at various levels, and it is impossible to stop this process."

There is an opinion that it is time for us to overcome our differences and recognize the social-democratic parties as useful and necessary elements for strengthening the working-class movement.
