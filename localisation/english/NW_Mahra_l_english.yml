    MHR_trade_port_desc:0 "Although the port of Qishn is significantly inferior to Aden, trade still plays a significant role in our economy."
    MHR_sultan_army_desc:0 "We should expand the Sultan's personal army to ensure the security of our state."
    MHR_sultan_army_increase_desc:0 "Although the use of militias can save the state defense spending significantly, we still need a large enough personal army for the Sultan to secure our country."
    MHR_ladan_desc:0 "For centuries, frankincense mining has played an extremely important role in the economy of the Sultanate of Mahra, located on the so-called Way of Incense. We should strive to expand the extraction of this aromatic resin to try to beat the dominance of the Sultanate of Muscat in the incense market."
    MHR_slaves_desc:0 "Slavery has not yet been abolished in our country. Many slaves are engaged in hard physical labor in the fields and the port. But most of them live in the homes of their masters, working as servants. Paradoxically, the standard of living of these slaves far exceeds that of ordinary citizens; the slaves often even receive a fairly good education and are drafted into the sultan's personal army."
    MHR_yafai_desc:0 "In our country, yafai mercenaries constitute a separate caste. Their ancestors were once invited to military service by the rulers of Hadramaut, and the warrior's craft has since become hereditary."
    MHR_GB_bitch_desc:0 "Our country has long been under British protectorate. There is no point in trying to remedy that situation."
    MHR_fishing_desc:0 "The waters that wash over Qishn and Socotra are rich in fish. Its catch plays a great part in the provisions of our country's population."
    MHR_finiks_desc:0 "Dates are the most readily available food in our country. The caloric fruits of the date tree cover much of the population's food needs, and their sale abroad is the basis of our exports."
    MHR_trade_desc:0 "Kuwait and India are our nation's major trading partners. Our merchants have made a considerable fortune exporting our goods to these countries."
    MHR_camels_desc:0 "Al-Mahra is home to the Mehri camel, which was an integral part of the military success of the Mahri army in the past. This breed is known for its speed, agility, and endurance. Mehri camels have a large but slender build, and because of their small hump they are ideal for riding."
    MHR_tribes_control_desc:0 "Most countries on the Arabian Peninsula are fairly loosely centralized. We should increase control over the tribes of our country. This will help strengthen the Sultan's power and make him less dependent on Britain."
    MHR_hadramaut_independence_movement_desc:0 ""
    MHR_centralization_desc:0 "With the end of British rule, the Sultan can begin to reorganize the state apparatus, which used to be run by a protégé from London."
    MHR_social_desc:0 "For a long time all the money allocated went into the sultan's treasury, who spent it on building palaces and on his own upkeep. When Britain's handouts stopped, it was worth investing in more necessary initiatives."
    MHR_schools_of_quran_desc:0 "For ordinary citizens, Koranic schools are the only way to get an education. Students spend most of their time studying religious sciences, learning literacy at the same time. Attention is also given to secular subjects."
    MHR_no_consul_desc:0 "For many years our Sultan lived on British handouts while the state slowly withered. The Consultative Treaty in addition might deprive our ruler of autonomy in domestic politics as well, making the existence of the Mahra a legal formality. We will not allow that to happen."
    MHR_jews_settlers_desc:0 "As part of a program to maintain commerce within our state, it has been proposed to establish Jewish settlements on Socotra. When tensions are high in the world, it is still worth heeding these suggestions."
    MHR_arab_lang_desc:0 "The Mehri language prevalent in our state is not convenient for the conduct of public affairs because it has no written language. The language of worship is more attractive to the administration of the bureaucracy."
    MHR_subdue_hadramaut_desc:0 "Hadramaut has long been divided into various independent sultanates. It is time for that to end."
    MHR_jews_out_desc:0 "The insignificant Jewish settlement on Socotra is the engine of our state's commerce, but following a policy of isolationism it is worth driving the community off the island."
    MHR_mehri_lang_desc:0 "Socotrian and Mehri are the mother language for most in our country. Having no written language, by simplifying some pronunciations and bringing them into a unified form, there is an opportunity to gain tribal support."
    MHR_def_socotra_desc:0 "Socotra is the jewel of our country; it has the largest incense production, which only 1,000 families in the entire Arabian Peninsula have the right to collect. In order to prevent the loss of the most important archipelago, it must be dealt with to strengthen it."
    MHR_yes_consul_desc:0 "Signing a consultative treaty would deprive our state of autonomy, but refusing to sign at all would only lead to the destruction of the Mahra Sultanate. In the present situation, we have no right to choose."

    MHR_generic_irregular_army_category_desc:0 "Our country still consists of many tribes subordinate to their chiefs. This does not allow the state to maintain a large enough regular army, but in the event of war we can summon in a short time a sufficiently armed and numerous tribal militia."
